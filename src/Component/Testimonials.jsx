It only took a few minutes to set up a profile and I was soon matched with multiple people with similar interests and lifestyles. RoomSync made it super easy for me to find Kevin with whom I am already planning on living with again next year! I will definitely continue to use RoomSync and am constantly recommending it to friends and family!`

Finally, my search was over! My roommate is the best, and this was all possible because of RoomSync!"`
